<h1>Two Cute Candles 🕯️✨</h1>
    <p>
        This repository features a fun and adorable animation built using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. The project showcases two candles with unique personalities, brought to life through creative animations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Short Candle</strong>: Initially lit and shining brightly.</li>
        <li><strong>The Tall Candle</strong>: Enviously unlit and ready to stir up some mischief.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Animation Highlights:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The <strong>Tall Candle</strong> blows out the <strong>Short Candle's</strong> flame, leaving the room in darkness. 🌬️💨</li>
        <li>The <strong>Short Candle</strong>, now angry, reignites itself in a dramatic comeback! 😡🔥</li>
        <li>The cycle repeats, creating an engaging and delightful loop. 🔄</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This project is a playful demonstration of CSS animations and creative storytelling through simple web development. Perfect for learning animation basics or just enjoying a fun, light-hearted coding project!
